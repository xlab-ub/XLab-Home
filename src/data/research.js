                description: "We introduce and study the fine-grained domain relevance of termsâ€“ an important property of terms that has not been carefully studied before. We propose a hierarchical core-fringe domain relevance learning approach, which can cover almost all terms in human languages and various domains, while requires little or even no human annotation.",

After that, we propose a two-step model to investigate semantic capacity of terms, which consists of the of fline construction and the online query processes. The offline construction process places domain-specificterms in the hyperbolic space by our proposed Lorentz model with NPMI, and the online query process deals with user requirements, where semantic capacity is interpreted by norms of embeddings.",

To this end, we first design a new framework named object-centric compositional attention model (OCCAM) to perform the visual reasoning task with object-level visual features. Then, we come up with a method to induce concepts of objects and relations using clues from the attention patterns between objects' visual features and question words. Finally, we achieve a higher level of interpretability by imposing OCCAM on the objects represented in the induced symbolic concept space.",

                description: "We study the problem of the Trojan network (TrojanNet) detection in the data-scarce regime, where only the weights of a trained DNN are accessed by the detector. We first propose a data-limited TrojanNet detector (TND), when only a few data samples are available for TrojanNet detection. We show that an effective data-limited TND can be established by exploring connections between Trojan attack and prediction-evasion adversarial attacks including per-sample attack as well as all-sample universal attack. In addition, we propose a data-free TND, which can detect a TrojanNet without accessing any data samples.",
