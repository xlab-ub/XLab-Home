# Intro
Dr. Jinjun Xiong is an **Empire Innovation Professor** with the **Department of Computer Science & Engineering, University at Buffalo (UB)** . He received his Ph.D. degree in 2006 from **University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA)** with an Outstanding Ph.D. Award, his M.S. degree from **University of Wisconsin, Madison** in 2002, and his M.S. and B.S. degrees from **Tsinghua University** in 2000 and 1998, respectively.

Before joining UB in 2021, Dr. Xiong was Program Director and Senior Research Scientist at **IBM T.J. Watson Research Center, Yorktown Heights, NY**.  He co-founded and co-directed the **IBM-Illinois Center for Cognitive Computing Systems Research** with Prof. Wen-mei Hwu. Under their leadership, the C3SR center has expanded from the early days' eight faculty members in 2016 to close to 40 faculty members in 2021. The success of the C3SR center also led to the creation of the new IBM-Illinois Discovery Accelerator Institute, a joint $200-million research investment between IBM and UIUC. Dr. Xiong also co-founded the **IBM Smarter Energy Research Institute** and led a number of enterprise-scale collaborations with world-wide electric utility companies to address sustainability issues with renewable integration.
